## Ubuntu
if you want to run bot in background on Ubuntu you can use a systemd setup:
1. you can install bot manually or you can use single command line instalation.
2. terminate bot if its running using ctrl+c (hold it)
3. create a systemd file by this command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cfwbot.service
```

4. copy paste this systemd configuartion. CHANGE WorkingDirectory if your bot path is diffrent, if your user is differnt change that as well.CTRL+X and ENTER to save.

```bash                             
[Unit]
Description=CFW-BOT
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/CFW-BOT/
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 cfw.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

5. Enable and Start Service
   
```bash
sudo systemctl enable cfwbot
sudo systemctl start cfwbot
sudo systemctl status cfwbot
```

## LAZY INSTALL
1. Register for a free account on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
2. Obtain the required API keys:
   - Telegram Bot token from BotFather
   - Cloudflare API key from Cloudflare dashboard (make sure to select "Edit Cloudflare Workers template" and grant necessary permissions, all of them should have EDIT permission)
   - Telegram UserID you can obtain it from here https://t.me/useridinfobot or any similar bot you know
   - Cloudflare Account id, you can find it from right side of overview page or worker page in cloudflare
4. in your Dashboard section Select Files and and Click on "Open Bash Console Here"
5.  Clone this repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/2ri4eUI/CFW-BOT.git
```
6. Navigate to the project directory:

 ```bash
 cd CFW-BOT
 ```
7. Make `requirement.sh` executable:
 ```bash
 chmod +x requirement.sh
 ```

8. Run `requirement.sh`:
 ```bash
 ./requirement.sh
 ```
"If you encounter errors running requirement.sh on PythonAnywhere , simply close the console (using `exit` command) , go to file manager and open it and  save it (use `ctrl+s` ) without changing any thing. thats it! now you can run it"
another solution is converting it using dos2unix 
since PythonAnyWhere does not support that you can use this simple python code 'dos2unix.py'
you can run this to solve the issue:
 ```bash
 python3 dos2unix.py
 ```

 ```bash
 python3 install.py
 ```

Creating a new user is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to get started:
**Obtain Cloudflare IP or Domain:**
   - Use platforms like [fofa.info](https://fofa.info) to find Cloudflare IP addresses or domains.
   - Example search query for fofa.info:

 server=="cloudflare" && port=="443" && country=="NL" && city=="Amsterdam"
 ```
   - Choose based on your preferences and network speed.

This bot is designed to be lightweight and inexpensive to run, making it accessible for everyone. Enjoy creating Xray links hassle-free!


## Disclaimer

I want to acknowledge the work of others and clarify that the `index.js` and `subworker.js` file is not my original work. It has been edited solely to ensure compatibility with the bot. 

## HUGE THANKS TO

This project is just the beginning, and there is potential for it to evolve further. The extent to which it progresses depends on how much it is liked and used. Your feedback and contributions are appreciated!
